Big Picture
-----------

- Examples
  - virtual assistant
- Industry 4.0
- Human and AI symbiosis
- "Machine Learning" this keywords surpass "Big Data"
- The terms:
  - Data Science uses statistics and ML to monetize information in data.
  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) deals with machines that achieve a human-level performance at specific tasks such as face or speech recognition, machine translation, credit approvals, etc.
  - Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-field of AI that teaches computers to perform tasks from experience.
- Applied AI (weak AI) VS AGI (strong AI)
- rational agent
- computers store data are called database
- The goal of learning is the ability to generalize from data
- Statistical Modeling VS Machine Learning
  - Statistical Modeling:
    - Parametric model: try to **explain** the world, focus on modeling causality
    - Deduce relations
    - Small data (1-100 features, 100-1000 samples)
    - based on probabilistic approach
  - ML:
    - Non-parametric model: try to **mimic** the world (rather than explain it). Often use correlations as proxies to causality.
    - Induce
    - large data
    - not probabilistic
    
#### Tasks T
- Perception Tasks
  - perception and learning from data
  - fixed action
  - outputs: learned fucntion of data
- Action Tasks
  - multiple possible actions
  - involve sub-tasks
  - planning and forecasting the future
#### Performance Measure P
- Metric
  - we want to get the difficiate function
#### Experience E
- Supervised (perception task)
  - correct feedback from "teacher"
- Unsupervised
  - no "teacher
- Reinforcement Learning
  - only partial feedback (a reward)

#### ML Landscape
- Supervised (perception tasks)
  - Regression
  - Classification
- Unsupervised (perception tasks)
  - Clustering
  - Representation Learning
    - feature extraction, dimension reduction
- Reinforcement Learning (action tasks)
  - Optimization of strategy for a task
  - Inverse Reinforcement Learning
    - no info for reward
    - find the reward function that explains behavior
