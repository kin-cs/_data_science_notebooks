# Lessons Learnt from Experience

### Â The importance of "User Stories" and "Acceptance Criteria"
- Example: A lot of times, Product Owners didn't have a clear picture of what the final products should look like. They only have a very basic idea of the concept.
- Suggestion: Introduce these 2 concepts to them, and lay it down from the start.

### Figuring out the dependencies in every item
- Example: Product Owner has to come back and forth for discussing with different units to make one decision. Moreover, they would keep changing it in the course of these few months. It hinders how each item moving forward.
- Suggestion: Try to figure out all the dependencies earlier on in DAY 1, and also create the actionable task for decision making.

### Focusing on Daily Scrum
- Example: It always runs overtime as the new extra topics would be popping up and they will divert from Daily Scrum items.
- Suggestion: Steer them back when new topics pop up, and create the other time slots for discussing the new topics
