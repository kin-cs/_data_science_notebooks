Bayesian Optimization of hyper-paremeters
----------------------------------------

#### Level 1
- (Don't use) Grid Search.

  Reason: it wastes so much time on the parameters which don't have any effect for the model
  
  
#### Level 2
- Random Combination

- Guassian Process models


Basic
=====

Cross-entropy
-------------
The more ideal (top is the most ideal)
- Cross-entropy loss function
- mean squared loss function
- classification Error
