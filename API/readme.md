#### Keywords
- Swagger - open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful Web services- https://swagger.io
  
### Notes:
- flask’s inbuilt server is not suitable for production as it doesn’t scale well. You’ll need to use a WSGI server to run your flask application. eg. gunicorn, uwsgi.
